## Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

A simple to use shiny application that performs a linear regression model
on the `data(longley)` dataset in R. A data frame with 7 economic variables, observed yearly from 1947 to 1962.

By selecting a population size the application will calculate the regression model, predict the number of unemployed,
and display the results.
